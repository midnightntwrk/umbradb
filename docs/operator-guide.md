# UmbraDB operator guide

For the operator who runs an UmbraDB indexer: the commands it ships and what each needs on the machine. The
specification is the OpenSpec change `core-arch` (`openspec/changes/core-arch/`); this guide names its requirements
where it relies on them.

## Backups

A backup is a `pg_dump` file of the indexer's database at one committed height, with UmbraDB's manifest as its first
line (BK-1, BK-2). Use it to move an indexer to a new server, or to start a new instance mid-chain without syncing from
genesis. Checking that two databases hold the same data is a different job: compare their contents hashes and per-table
digests (`/status`), not their backup files — two backups of equal data need not be equal byte for byte.

### Writing a backup

```sh
umbradb backup --out indexer-1774000.backup [--config umbradb.config.ts]
```

The command reads the configuration file — `--config`, or `umbradb.config.ts` in the working directory, as `umbradb
run` does — for the database, the side (core or private) and the development opt-in, and writes the file once the
backup is complete: a failed or interrupted backup leaves no file at that path, and an earlier file there is kept. It
prints the file, the height, the contents hash and the tool, and exits 0; it exits 1 when refused, and 2 on a wrong
argument.

- **On PostgreSQL** it runs the PostgreSQL 18 client's `pg_dump`, in the snapshot of a read that also reads the
  manifest: the backup holds exactly one committed height while the indexer goes on writing beside it. `pg_dump` is
  not a dependency of UmbraDB: install the PostgreSQL 18 client (`postgresql-client-18` on Debian and Ubuntu,
  `postgresql18` on Alpine and Fedora, `postgresql@18` with Homebrew) and put its `pg_dump` on `PATH`, or name it with
  `UMBRADB_PG_DUMP=/path/to/pg_dump`. A missing `pg_dump`, or one of another major version, fails with
  `backup-tools-missing` and says what to install. The database URL's password reaches `pg_dump` in its environment,
  never on its command line.
- **On PGlite** (a development database, under the development opt-in) it runs `pg_dump` of
  `@electric-sql/pglite-tools`, which is not installed with UmbraDB either: `npm install
  @electric-sql/pglite-tools@0.4.10`, the version made for UmbraDB's PGlite 0.5.10. A PGlite directory opens in one
  process at a time: while the indexer runs on it the command refuses with `writer-lock-held`. Back a running PGlite
  indexer up through the process itself — set `backupAtStop`, below, or, from a host program, call its handle's
  `backup(file)`, which runs between two blocks.
- **A private process's database** is not backed up by UmbraDB unless the development opt-in is set (PP-12):
  `private-backup-refused`. PostgreSQL's own tools can still copy it; that rule governs only what UmbraDB writes.

### A backup at the core's stop

Set the `core` entry's `backupAtStop` to a file path (relative to the process's working directory): right after the
core's stop height commits, the process writes a backup of that height there (CORE-ARCH §4.15). A restart with the
cursor at the stop writes none while the file there is a backup of that height; a backup of another height there is
replaced once the new one is complete. A file there that is not an UmbraDB backup is never overwritten: the process
logs `backup at stop failed (backup-format-unknown)` and stays `stopped`.

### What a backup holds

Every table of the database, as plain SQL (`--inserts --no-owner --no-privileges`), at the manifest's height — tables
declared `deterministic: false` with their rows and their sequences' positions. A sequence is not transactional:
taken beside a running indexer on PostgreSQL, its position in the file can be ahead of its table's rows (never behind
them), so values a restored indexer gives such a column may skip some numbers.

### Restoring a backup

```sh
umbradb restore indexer-1774000.backup [--config umbradb.config.ts]
```

**Restore only backups from a source you trust — your own.** A restore runs the file's SQL with the database login's
rights: a file that was changed, or written by someone else, can create functions, triggers or views, change any
table, and on a server whose login is a superuser do more than that, before any check after loading can refuse it
(BK-3, owner decision Q83). The manifest's checks and the contents hash catch a backup that is damaged or from another
chain; they do not make a hostile file safe to run.

The command restores into the configuration file's database, which must be empty — a new PostgreSQL database, or a
PGlite directory with no database in it (the command creates it). The configuration must be the one the backup's
indexer ran with: the same S and the same entries up to the backup's height (later changes, above it, are allowed),
and a build that carries their versions and every migration the backup's database applied. The command reads the
configuration's node to check the chain. It refuses, and leaves the target as it was, when:

| Code | Why |
|---|---|
| `restore-target-not-empty` | the target holds a schema, or anything in `public` |
| `backup-format-unknown` | the file is no backup of format 1, or its SQL holds what a restore does not run (a `psql` meta-command other than `\restrict`/`\unrestrict`, a `COPY … FROM stdin`, a cut-off end) |
| `backup-history-mismatch` | the configuration's S or its history up to the backup's height differs from the backup's |
| `backup-build-mismatch` | the build lacks the version of an entry at the backup's height + 1, or a migration the backup applied |
| `backup-genesis-mismatch` | the node serves another chain |
| `backup-block-not-finalized` | the node has not finalized the backup's block, or finalized another one at its height |
| `contents-hash-mismatch` | the restored data is not what the backup's manifest says (checked before the commit) |
| `backup-root-mismatch` | with `core-ledger-state`, the stored ledger state root at the backup's height is not the node's |

The first six are checked before anything is loaded; the last two after loading, inside the restore's one transaction,
which then rolls back. A restore interrupted halfway — a crash, a kill — leaves the target empty, and can be run again.
The restored database gets UmbraDB's module roles (created on the server if missing: the login needs `CREATEROLE`, as
for a first start) and the owners and grants a database built by migrations has. Start the indexer on it with the same
configuration: it keeps the backup's S and resumes from the backup's height + 1.

A private process's backup (written under the development opt-in) is restored the same way, with the private
process's configuration: the command checks it against the configured public database instead of a node — read as the
private process reads it, a PostgreSQL `publicDatabase` directly or else through the core's transport at
`coreTransport`, so a PGlite public database needs its core running —: the public database's genesis hash and S must
be the ones the backup's database is bound to, else `private-binding-mismatch` names which (`public-not-started`,
`network` and `private-start-below` before loading; `genesis` and `start`, read from the backup's own binding, after
loading, inside the restore's transaction), and the public database's committed block at the backup's height must be
the backup's (`backup-block-not-finalized`). The restored private process continues from its public database at the
backup's height + 1.
