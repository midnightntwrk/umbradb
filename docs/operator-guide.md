# UmbraDB operator guide

For the operator who runs an UmbraDB indexer: the commands it ships and what each needs on the machine. The
specification is the OpenSpec change `core-arch` (`openspec/changes/core-arch/`); this guide names its requirements
where it relies on them.

## Backups

A backup is a `pg_dump` file of the indexer's database at one committed height, with UmbraDB's manifest as its first
line (BK-1, BK-2). Use it to move an indexer to a new server, or to start a new instance mid-chain without syncing from
genesis. Checking that two databases hold the same data is a different job: compare their contents hashes and per-table
digests (`/status`), not their backup files — two backups of equal data need not be equal byte for byte.

### Writing a backup

```sh
umbradb backup --out indexer-1774000.backup [--config umbradb.config.ts]
```

The command reads the configuration file — `--config`, or `umbradb.config.ts` in the working directory, as `umbradb
run` does — for the database, the side (core or private) and the development opt-in, and writes the file once the
backup is complete: a failed or interrupted backup leaves no file at that path, and an earlier file there is kept. It
prints the file, the height, the contents hash and the tool, and exits 0; it exits 1 when refused, and 2 on a wrong
argument.

- **On PostgreSQL** it runs the PostgreSQL 18 client's `pg_dump`, in the snapshot of a read that also reads the
  manifest: the backup holds exactly one committed height while the indexer goes on writing beside it. `pg_dump` is
  not a dependency of UmbraDB: install the PostgreSQL 18 client (`postgresql-client-18` on Debian and Ubuntu,
  `postgresql18` on Alpine and Fedora, `postgresql@18` with Homebrew) and put its `pg_dump` on `PATH`, or name it with
  `UMBRADB_PG_DUMP=/path/to/pg_dump`. A missing `pg_dump`, or one of another major version, fails with
  `backup-tools-missing` and says what to install. The database URL's password reaches `pg_dump` in its environment,
  never on its command line.
- **On PGlite** (a development database, under the development opt-in) it runs `pg_dump` of
  `@electric-sql/pglite-tools`, which is not installed with UmbraDB either: `npm install
  @electric-sql/pglite-tools@0.4.10`, the version made for UmbraDB's PGlite 0.5.10. A PGlite directory opens in one
  process at a time: while the indexer runs on it the command refuses with `writer-lock-held`. Back a running PGlite
  indexer up through the process itself — set `backupAtStop`, below, or, from a host program, call its handle's
  `backup(file)`, which runs between two blocks.
- **A private process's database** is not backed up by UmbraDB unless the development opt-in is set (PP-12):
  `private-backup-refused`. PostgreSQL's own tools can still copy it; that rule governs only what UmbraDB writes.

### A backup at the core's stop

Set the `core` entry's `backupAtStop` to a file path (relative to the process's working directory): right after the
core's stop height commits, the process writes a backup of that height there (CORE-ARCH §4.15). A restart with the
cursor at the stop writes none while the file there is a backup of that height; a backup of another height there is
replaced once the new one is complete. A file there that is not an UmbraDB backup is never overwritten: the process
logs `backup at stop failed (backup-format-unknown)` and stays `stopped`.

### What a backup holds

Every table of the database, as plain SQL (`--inserts --no-owner --no-privileges`), at the manifest's height — tables
declared `deterministic: false` with their rows and their sequences' positions. A sequence is not transactional:
taken beside a running indexer on PostgreSQL, its position in the file can be ahead of its table's rows (never behind
them), so values a restored indexer gives such a column may skip some numbers.
